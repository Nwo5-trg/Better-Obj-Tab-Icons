 Better Object Tab Icons is a mod to change the default object tab icons with *better* ones in an easily configurable way.
 
 The mod is also fully compatible with texture packs so you can add your own icons!

~(also this is my first proper geode mod and first experience with c++ in general so sorry if the code is unoptimised :3)~

# THIS MOD HASN'T BEEN TESTED WITH WINDOWS AND ANDROID BUT IT SHOULD PROBABLY WORK HOPEFULLY :3

## Settings
Every tab has a toggle for using custom or normal textures, a few have an in-built alt texture you can also toggle. *(I will probably not be adding alt texture support to every tab so dont use those if you are making custom icons)*

## Making Custom Icons
Every icon is scaled to be 100px by 100px and for it to cover the entire canvas, so when making custom icons make sure they are 100x100.

To change the icon of a tab, just name your file the reference name of the tab. *(All reference names are in the mod settings in apostrophes.)* So for example a file modifying the pixel tab icon would be `pixel-tab.png`

After you have all your files, make an empty folder, inside of it make another folder called `"nwo5.better_object_tab_icons"`. Just place all the textures you made into there and load the texture pack using geodes texture loader.

(ps i have no idea what im doing with github or geode)
